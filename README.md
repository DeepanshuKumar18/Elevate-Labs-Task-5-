Welcome to Task 5 of my Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs!

# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Analyst internship task, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
The goal was to explore patterns, trends, and relationships in the data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
---

##  Objectives
- Clean the dataset and handle missing values.
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Visualize key patterns affecting survival rates.
- Provide clear observations for each visual.
- Summarize overall findings from the analysis.
---

##  Dataset Details
The analysis was done on a **merged dataset** combining:
- `train.csv` – training data with survival labels.
- `test.csv` – test data without survival labels.
- `gender_submission.csv` – sample submission file with survival predictions.
**Features include:**
- **PassengerId** – unique passenger identifier  
- **Survived** – target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- **Pclass** – passenger class (1, 2, 3)  
- **Name, Sex, Age** – demographic details  
- **SibSp, Parch** – family aboard count  
- **Ticket, Fare, Cabin** – ticket details  
- **Embarked** – port of embarkation (C, Q, S)  
---

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced plots
---

##  Summary of Findings
1. Overall survival rate was low (~38%).
2. Gender was the most influential factor in survival.
3. Passenger class and fare had strong effects on survival chances.
4. Younger passengers had slightly higher survival rates.
5. The analysis aligns with the historical "women and children first" policy.
